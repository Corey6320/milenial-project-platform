# Milenial Project Platform

**Corey Pittman’s Milenial Inc Compliance Platform**  
A dual-track Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) + Compliance-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform 
Built for government procurement readiness and equity-focused onboarding.

---

## 🔍 Overview
Milenial Inc is building a live, compliance-first digital platform that serves two functions:

- **CaaS:** Guides underrepresented businesses through real government compliance
- **SaaS:** Offers infrastructure tools to operate, monitor, and document that journey

The platform is being built and tested in real time using Milenial Inc as its own first subject. The founder’s journey is embedded in every logic flow, document upload, rejection scenario, and workaround.

## 📌 Compliance Positioning
This platform is not theoretical — it’s built by someone who’s actively navigating rejection, onboarding blocks, and compliance gaps. The errors are part of the design. This is about transparency, equity, and automation that grows from actual barriers.

> "Every barrier I break becomes a feature in the platform."
